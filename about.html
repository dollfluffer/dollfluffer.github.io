    <p>First things first I need to introduce myself right?</p>
    <p>Nice to meet you! My name is Derek. I'm a 17 year old computer lover (i'm currently in a relationship with a computer) who lives in the United States of Guns and Fast Food.</p>
    <p>My hobbies include not exercising, not exercising and anything but exercising.</p>
    <p>I happen to be a pretty hardcore anime junky so if you're interested in that, hmu ladies ;)</p>
    <p>I spend my free time learning about programming, producing music and occasionally designing some stuffs.</p>
    <p>I'm a staff member at Haruhichan (an awesome spot for all your anime needs) we're always looking to expand our userbase so feel free to drop by! </p>
    <p>Hmm let's see what else did I forget? Oh! I really really really love Hunter x Hunter and my waifu is Neferpitou (I know I know bad choice right? I have failed you)</p>
    <p>I'm a pretty nice guy and i'll talk to almost anyone, so don't hesitate to say hello!</p>
    <p>Oh and one last thing, I make a million mistakes daily so you'll have to get used to that, try not to laugh okay?</p>
    <p>That's all I can think of for now, If you're curious about anything else feel free to shoot me a question on my Ask.fm</p>
